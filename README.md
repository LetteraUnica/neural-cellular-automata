A lizard who has been given regenerative powers form the new adversarial cells

## What is this?
This is the code and experiments of the paper Adversarial Takeover of Neural Cellular Automata, published in ALIFE 2022.  
We added **adversaries** to a **Neural Cellular Automaton** in order to change its color, shape or even both!

## Getting Started  
We have created a [**page**](https://letteraunica.github.io/neural_cellular_automata) with the video explanation and all the resources to learn about the work and experiments.

## Installation and Usage
To use this package you just have to clone the repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/LetteraUnica/neural_cellular_automata
```

After cloning, execute 

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

which will install all the required packages to run the code.  

## Extras
Extra videos and resources can be found [**here**](https://LetteraUnica.github.io/neural_cellular_automata/extra)
