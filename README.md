## What is this?
This is the code and experiments of the paper Adversarial Takeover of Neural Cellular Automata published in ALIFE 2022.  
We studied and extended a **Neural Cellular Automaton** aiming at the simulation of **self-organizing** structures' processes of growth, persistence in time and regeneration after a damage.

## Getting Started  
We created a [**Colab notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jh7MZPxE_05-04neyX2XxYbvq1O457aG?usp=sharing) where you can run all the experiments present in the article in a more user-friendly way.  
The notebook also acts as a tutorial, as everything is commented and explained in detail.

## Installation and Usage
To use this package you just have to clone the repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/LetteraUnica/neural_cellular_automata
```

After cloning, execute 

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

which will install all the required packages to run the code.
