# Expanding lifespan of Cellular Automatae

###### Contributors: *Cavuoti Lorenzo*, *Sacco Francesco*
## Introduction
We studied and implemented a **Neural Cellular Automaton** aiming at the simulation of **self-organizing** structures' processes of growth, persistence in time and regeneration after a damage.

The paper has been accepted to the Alife 2022 conference, and it will be out in late june

## Installation and Usage
To use this package you just have to clone the repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/LetteraUnica/neural_cellular_automata
```

After cloning, execute 

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

which will install all the required packages to run the code.
