# Neural Cellular Automaton

###### Deep Learning exam 2020-2021

###### Group members: *Cavuoti Lorenzo*, *Sicklinger Marco*

## Introduction
We studied and implemented a **Neural Cellular Automaton** aiming at the simulation of **self-organizing** structures' processes of growth, persistence in time and regeneration after a damage.

The presentation of the project can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c2JkIgbuHCxGZLgb3y7ITkac3qg1O5qFywbTcJILwYc/edit?usp=sharing)
