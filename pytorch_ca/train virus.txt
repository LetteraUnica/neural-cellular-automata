## The goal is to keep the train loss below 0.01 at the end of each step

# Step 1 (Warmup)
Starting from two growing CAs

## Generator
virus_rate=0.9, iter_func=ExponentialSampler(min=48, max=64)

## Losses
NCALoss + ConstantWeight(16, np.inf), CellRatioLoss(penalization=0.1) + ConstantWeight(16, np.inf)

## Train params
lr=2e-3

n_epochs=10, skip_update=1, batch_size=16,
scheduler=scheduler, kind="persistent", skip_damage=1, n_max_losses=2,
evolution_iters=32

# Step 2 (Killing)

Same as step 1 but penalization=1 in CellRatioLoss

# Step 3 (Training 90%)
n_max_losses=1,
evolution_iters=64

Now the model is trained for 90%, to make it better you could run a longer training

# Step 4 (Training 70%)
virus_rate=0.7
NCALoss + ConstantWeight(32, np.inf), CellRatioLoss(penalization=1) + ConstantWeight(32, np.inf)

# Step 5 (Training 50%)
virus_rate=0.5
NCALoss + ConstantWeight(64, np.inf), CellRatioLoss(penalization=1) + ConstantWeight(64, np.inf)
evolution_iters=96
