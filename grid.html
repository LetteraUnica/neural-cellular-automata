  <h1>Stopping Aging in Neural Cellular Automata</h1>
  <h2>
    In this paper we are going to discuss the condition necessary to make a mortal
    neural cellular automata, immortal

  <p>
    One of the limitations of using a fixed mask is that it can’t model what happens when a kind of cell
    overtakes the other. This is important because having the new cells overtake the old ones would be both more biologically plausible
    <dt-fn>because in biological organisms cells die and are replaced by new ones</dt-fn> and could
    reduce the minimum percentage of initial cells that need to be switched.
    In an ideal case, we would only substitute a small percentage of cells, then these would gradually overtake the entire organism,
    making it immortal (<a href="#illutration_replacement">Figure 7</a>).
    <dt-fn>
      The minimum percentage required depends from the speed of the aging process, if it's slow
      you can start with fewer cells since they will have plenty of time to overtake the old ones
    </dt-fn>

      Figure 7: The idea is that the new cells learn to overtake the old one and than make the organism immortal,
      so you need to inject fewer cells in the new organism
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    To make this work we first have to ask ourselves how do we model the evolution of the mask?

        Figure 9: The vector on the left represents the old represetation of the CA state, and the one
        on the right is the new representation. This new representation of the cells has an additional
        $\alpha$ channel and to make the code simpler the alpha channels are now the last two components 
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    For simplicity we are going to restrict ourself in the case where we are going to have 2 rules ($f_1$ and $f_2$). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Before, a cell state was represented by a state vector having the first 4 components representing
    the RGBA of the pixel and the remaining were hidden channels that helped the CA pass
    information between its cells. If the $\alpha$ channel (transparency) is >0.1 it means
    that the cell is alive, otherwise it’s dead
  </p> 
  <p>
    If we are going to have two different types of cells we are going to need two alpha channels.
    Since a cell cannot be of both kinds at the same time we choose that if $\alpha_1$ is $>0.1$, then
    $\alpha_2$ must be 0, and the cell update follows $f_1$ and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, when both alphas are below $0.1$, the cell evolves with the average of both updates (<a href="#evolving_mask">Figure 8,9</a>).

        Figure 8: The color of the cells in the image on the left represets the kind of cell.
        Different kind of cell have different rules of evolution
      </p>
      <p id="red" style="font-family: inherit; margin-top: inherit; margin-bottom: inherit;">
        The red cells have $\alpha_1>0.1$ and $\alpha_2=0$, and follow the rule $f_1$. They represent the cells that are alive and of kind 1.
      </p>
      <p id="yellow" style="font-family: inherit; margin-top: inherit; margin-bottom: inherit;">
        The yellow cells have $\alpha_2>0.1$ and $\alpha_1=0$, and follow the rule $f_2$. They represent the cells that are alive and of kind 2.
      </p>
      <p id="light_red" style="font-family: inherit; margin-top: inherit; margin-bottom: inherit;">
        The light red cells have $\alpha_1 \le 0.1$ and $\alpha_2=0$. They occupy the cells that are neighboring to the red cells, but do not neighbor the yellow cells. They follow $f_1$
      </p>
      <p id="light_yellow"style="font-family: inherit; margin-top: inherit; margin-bottom: inherit;">
        The light yellow cells have $\alpha_2 \le 0.1$ and $\alpha_1=0$. They occupy the cells that are neighboring to the yellow cells, but do not neighbor the red cells. They follow $f_2$
      </p>
      <p id="orange" style="font-family: inherit; margin-top: inherit; margin-bottom: inherit;">
        The light orange cells have $\alpha_1 \le 0.1$ and $\alpha_2 \le 0.1$. They occupy the cells that are neighboring to both red and yellow cells. They follow the average of both rules
      </p>
    </div> 
  </figure>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that neither update rules can directly influence the neighboring cells directly, so the adversarial
    is forced to rely on changing its internal state in such a way that the other cell's rule makes it kill itself
