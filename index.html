        Most living organisms age and eventually die because of it, but a few don’t, and some of them are
        incredibly hard to kill, even if you cut their head off, it just regrows.
        Neural Cellular Automata are very good representation of living organisms and scientists
        have been able to recreate cellural automata that are able to represent any image, some of them are mortal,
        some of them are immortal, and some of them are able to regenerate incredibly effectively
        <d-cite key="randazzo2021adversarial"></d-cite>

      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper we are going to discuss the condition necessary to make a mortal neural cellular automata, immortal
      </p>
        <h2 id="perturbation">Adding a perturbation</h2>
        <p>
          We wanted to know if we can add a small perturbation to the output of a growing cellular automata
          in order to make it a persistent one, this is very interesting from a biological perspective because
          we can answer the question: 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          How much do we need to change the rule (or DNA) in order to have a non-aging organism? 
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        
        </p>
        <h3 id="model1">Model</h3>
          <p>
            We model the perturbation as a function of the cell state, note that the perturbation
            can be any function of the cell state, however we chose to use another CA to model it.
            Finally we compute the next cell state as a sum of both the growing and the perturbation,
          </p>
          <d-math block>
            x_{new} = f(x_{old}) + \Delta f(x_{old}).
          </d-math>
          <p>
            To prevent that the perturbation will overwrite the growing part we added an additional term in
            the loss, which penalizes the $\mathbf L_2$ norm of the perturbation, the goal is to keep the perturbation as
            low as possible and prevent that the perturbation will overwrite the growing part of the rule
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out that a very little perturbation (about 20% w.r.t. the total norm)
            can make the growing CA a persistent or even a regenerating one
          </p>

        <h3 id="conc1">Conclusion</h3>
          The rule that the growing learned is very close to a persistent/regenerating one,
          could this mean that we need a very little change in the DNA to make a real organism immortal?

        <h2 id="switch">Switching the rule</h2>
          <p>
            In this part of the paper we wanted to know if it is possible to take a cellular automata
            in the growing mode and after a arbitrary number $n$ of steps
            <d-footnote>By arbitrary we mean any number $n$ of steps before the cellular automata decays</d-footnote>
            we switch the update rule with the aim of becoming regenerating.
            We can write it mathematically like this
          </p>
          <d-math block>
            \begin{cases}
            x_{new}=f_1(x_{old})\quad \textrm{ if }\quad n_{iter} \le n\\
            x_{new}=f_2(x_{old})\quad \textrm{ if }\quad n_{iter} > n
            \end{cases}
          </d-math>
          <p>
            Where $f_1$ is a growing rule, and $f_2$ is the rule that we trained to make the organism regenerating
            <d-footnote>If we change $n$ we don't need to change $f_2$</d-footnote>
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want to make a parallel with a biological system this is equivalent to asking : Is it
            possible to make an organism immortal if we have the ability to change its DNA in every single
            cell at once?
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer is yes. Here is a video that shows what happens
            <d-figure id="switch" class="video-d-figure">
              <video style="width: 100%;" loop="" controls="" muted="">
                <source src="pytorch_ca/switch_visuals/switch25.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              </video>
            </d-figure>
          </p>

          
          <p>
            In order to achieve this we took a growing CA and evolved it for a number of steps between 0 and
            60, then we took the final state and passed it to a new cellular automata that we are going to call
            “Switch”.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we trained Switch to be able to become a Regenerating cellular automata
            starting from an input Growing
            <d-footnote>
              The training seemed to be highly dependent from the starting parameters, in particular if we started from a Regenerating CA the net seemed to converge faster, if we took another CA, often times it wasn't able to converge
            </d-footnote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some things you cannot do with our procedure:
            <ul>
              <li>You cannot just swap the Growing rule with another Regenerating rule</li>
              <li>You cannot use a Switch CA for a Growing one which has not been trained for</li>
              <li>You cannot salvage a Growing rule that has decayed</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
            
        <h2 id="virus">
          Applying the Virus
          <d-footnote>The training for this part is still in progress</d-footnote>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Realistically speaking if we want to make a grown organism immortal we aren’t going to have the precision necessary
          to be able to modify every single cell of the organism without missing even one
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to answer this we first have to ask ourselves how do we model a Cellular
          Automata that is able to represent an organism that has cells with a different DNA?
        </p>
        <h3 id="model2">Model</h3>
        <p>
          For simplicity we are going to restrict ourself in the case where we are going to
          have 2 rules ($r_1$ and $r_2$).
        </p>
        <p>
          Before a cell state was represented by a state vector having the first 4 components representing the
          RGBA of the pixel and the remaining were hidden channels that helped the CA have more information.
          The $\alpha$ channel (transparency) if it is >0.1 it means that the cell is alive, otherwise it’s dead
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are going to have two different types of cells we are going to need two alpha channels.
          Since a cell cannot be of both kinds at the same time we choose that if $\alpha_1$ is >0.1,
          then $\alpha_2$ must be 0, and it updates following $r_1$.
        </p>
        <p>
          when both alphas are below 0.1, than the cell evolves with the sum of both updates
        </p>
